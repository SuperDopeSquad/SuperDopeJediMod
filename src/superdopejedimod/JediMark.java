/*
 * NOTE:
 * 		This JediMark java class depends at run-time on the following other files:
 * 
 * 			The blockstate JSON file, which lists all the model variants (the different forms the block can take)
 * 			superdopejedimod/src/resources/assets/superdopejedimod/blockstates/jediMark.json
 * 		
 * 			The model JSON file that describes the 3D geometry for when the block is displayed in the world.
 * 			superdopejedimod/src/resources/assets/superdopejedimod/models/block/jediMark.json
 * 
 * 			The model JSON file that describes the 3D geometry for when the block is displayed in your hand.
 * 			superdopejedimod/src/resources/assets/superdopejedimod/models/item/jediMark.json
 * 
 * 			The PNG graphics file that will be displayed on each side of the block (note that we could change it
 *          to have different image son each side, but for now we have the same image repeated on all sides.
 * 			superdopejedimod/src/resources/assets/superdopejedimod/textures/blocks/jediMark.json
 * 
 * 		PNG files should be made with Photoshop or Gimp.
 * 
 * 		JSON files can be edited in any text editor, like Notepad, or Eclipse. But remember that JSON files have a 
 * 			specific and strict syntax (rules for how the text needs to be formatted), so each ({[ character is 
 * 			actually important!
 * 
 * 		SuperDopeSquad: Use this class as a template for creating other blocks. Duplicate this file, rename "JediMark" everywhere you
 * 			see it to a new name, and then duplicate all the above files, making sure to name the files the same name as
 * 			your new class.
 * 
 * 		READ all the comments below to see what each section of code is doing.
